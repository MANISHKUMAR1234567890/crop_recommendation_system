**Overview**:
This project aims to provide crop recommendations based on various factors using a Machine learning model (Logistic Regtression). By analyzing input features such as  climate situation , and other environmental parameters, the model predicts the most suitable crops for cultivation in a that particular area.


**Input Features**:
Climate conditions (temperature, rainfall, humidity),
Soil pH,
Nutrient levels(Nitrogen , phosphorous, potassium) ,

**Dataset**:
The model was trained on a dataset containing information about various crops along with corresponding environmental factors.
